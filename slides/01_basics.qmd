## What is <strong style="color: #daa520;">Deep Learning</strong>? 
<br> 

. . . 

<text style="color: #daa520;">Deep Learning</text> is:

- an approach to <strong style="color: blue;">Artificial Intelligence</strong>
- a type of <strong style="color: #32cd32;">Machine Learning</strong> that uses artificial neural networks

::: {.notes}
Before we dive into the deep learning, let's start with some key definitions.

We are going to go through each of the statements that relate these concepts that
often go together.

Deep Learning is an approach to Artificial Intelligence.

Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning based on artificial neural networks.
- ML enables computers to improve with experience and data

## Why is it so popular?

<br> 

. . . 

<text style="color: #daa520;">Deep Learning</text> achieves great power and flexibility by:

- gathering **knowledge from experience**
- being **compositional**



::: {.notes}
Deep Learning achieves great power and flexbility by:
1. Gathering knowledge from experience --> humans don’t formally specify the required knowledge
2. Being compositional --> representing the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts [many layers, “Deep”]

We are going to go through each of the statements that relate these concepts that
often go together.

. . .

From [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence):

- _Intelligence demonstrated by **machines**_
- _The study of **intelligent agents**_
- _Machines that mimic **human cognitive functions**_

::: {.notes}
- Intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural
intelligence displayed by humans
- Agents: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize
its chance of successfully achieving its goals
- human cognitive functions such as such as "learning" and "problem solving".

From Wikipedia
‐ As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require
"intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as
the AI effect.
‐ For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things
considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
‐ Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include
successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), 
autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.

How "traditional" ML algorithms depend heavily on the representation of the data

- We can see how representation is relevant also in everyday life: it is much easier for us to 
do arithmetics on arabic numerals vs roman numerals ("People can easily perform arithmetic
on Arabic numerals but ﬁnd arithmetic on Roman numerals much more timeconsuming.") Another
nice example is face recognition ([Thatcher effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_effect))

- E.g. cesarean delivery problem, the algorithm takes certain pieces of
information that represent the patient adequately for the problem.
(“features”). Logistic regression learns how these features correlate with various outcomes
but it cannot influence how these features are defined

- Sometimes hand‐designed representations are easy to obtain, but often it is difficult
to know what features to extract. E.g., detecting cars in photographs

- Representation learning: machine learning discipline that aims to discover not only the mapping 
from representation to output but also the representation itself. 

- Learnt representations often perform better and make AI systems easier to
adapt to new tasks. E.g., autoencoder

DL solves this by introducing a **hierarchical representation** of the data
- How does a computer go about understanding the meaning of raw sensory
input data? An image is just a collection of pixel values
- DL breaks down the mapping into a series of nested simple mappings, each
described by a different layer of the network
